## 🎯 How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Test as Instructor

1. **Login as instructor**
2. **Go to "My Courses"** and select a course
3. **Click "Edit Course"**
4. **Scroll to "Course Sections"**
5. **Click "Add Section"**
   - Enter title: "Introduction"
   - Enter description (optional)
   - Click "Save Section"
6. **Repeat** to create more sections (e.g., "Core Concepts", "Advanced Topics")
7. **Upload materials** and assign them to sections using the dropdown
8. **View sections** - they should show material counts and durations

**Expected Result:** ✅ Sections created successfully with materials assigned

### Step 3: Test as Learner

1. **Logout and login as learner** (or use different browser)
2. **Go to "My Enrollments"**
3. **Click on the course** you just edited
4. **View "Course Content"** section
5. **Click on section headers** to expand/collapse
6. **Watch videos** or open materials from within sections
7. **Complete some materials** and refresh - progress should update

**Expected Result:** ✅ Accordion sections working with materials inside

### Step 4: Test Backward Compatibility

1. **Create a new course** without sections
2. **Upload materials** without assigning to sections
3. **Enroll as learner** and view the course
4. **Expected:** Materials show in flat list (old behavior)

**Expected Result:** ✅ Courses without sections still work

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### Instructor Endpoints (AJAX):
```
POST   /instructor/courses/{courseId}/sections
GET    /instructor/courses/{courseId}/sections
PUT    /instructor/courses/{courseId}/sections/{sectionId}
DELETE /instructor/courses/{courseId}/sections/{sectionId}
POST   /instructor/courses/{courseId}/sections/{sectionId}/materials/{materialId}
DELETE /instructor/courses/{courseId}/materials/{materialId}/section
PUT    /instructor/courses/{courseId}/sections/reorder
```

### Learner Endpoints:
```
GET    /learner/enrollments/{id}  (now includes sections)
```

## 🎨 UI Screenshots (What to Expect)

### Instructor View:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Course Sections          [+ Add Section]   ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Section 1: Introduction                    ║
║ 📄 3 materials | ⏱️ 1h 15m                  ║

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility:
- ✅ **Old courses without sections** will display materials in a flat list
- ✅ **New courses** can use sections for better organization
- ✅ **Materials can exist without sections** (section_id is nullable)

### Data Integrity:
- ✅ Deleting a section does NOT delete materials (they become unassigned)
- ✅ Deleting a course cascades to delete all sections
- ✅ Section durations are auto-calculated from materials
- ✅ Progress tracking works per section

### Performance:
- ✅ Indexes on all foreign keys
- ✅ Efficient queries with JOIN FETCH
- ✅ AJAX for dynamic updates (no page reloads)

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No drag-and-drop reordering** - Can be added if needed
2. **Section progress** requires material completion (video tracker works)
3. **No bulk material assignment** - Materials assigned one at a time

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Database migration completed** (you confirmed it worked)
2. ⏳ **Test the features** using the steps above
3. 🎯 **Report any issues** you find
4. 🚀 **Start using sections** in your courses!

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Instructors:
1. **Plan your sections** before creating them (e.g., Introduction, Theory, Practice, Conclusion)
2. **Keep sections focused** - Each section should cover one topic
3. **Assign materials as you upload** using the dropdown
4. **Edit sections anytime** - Click the edit button to change title/description
5. **Monitor section durations** - They update automatically based on materials

### For Learners:
1. **Expand sections** to see materials
2. **Track progress** per section
3. **Complete materials sequentially** for best learning experience
4. **Watch videos** directly from sections (progress tracked automatically)
