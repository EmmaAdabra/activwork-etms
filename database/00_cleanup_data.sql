-- USE THIS SCRIPT TO CLEAN UP ALL DATA (NOT THE SCHEMA)
-- Run this before re-running 02_sample_data.sql
-- =====================================================

-- Set schema
SET search_path TO etms, public;

-- Disable triggers temporarily to avoid constraint issues
SET session_replication_role = 'replica';

-- =====================================================
-- DELETE ALL DATA (in correct order to respect FK constraints)
-- =====================================================

-- Delete data from tables with dependencies first
DELETE FROM course_analytics;
DELETE FROM notifications;
DELETE FROM material_progress;
DELETE FROM course_prerequisites;
DELETE FROM feedback;
DELETE FROM live_sessions;
DELETE FROM materials;
DELETE FROM enrollments;
DELETE FROM courses;
DELETE FROM users;

-- Re-enable triggers
SET session_replication_role = 'origin';
