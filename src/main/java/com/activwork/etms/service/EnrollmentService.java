/**
 * Service layer for Enrollment entity operations.
 * 
 * GRASP Pattern: Information Expert
 * - Expert on enrollment business rules and validation
 * - Knows when a learner can enroll in a course
 * - Responsible for progress tracking logic
 * 
 * Business Rules Enforced:
 * 1. Only learners can enroll in courses
 * 2. Cannot enroll in the same course twice
 * 3. Course must be published and active
 * 4. Enrollment capacity must not be exceeded
 * 5. Enrollment deadline must not have passed
 * 6. Prerequisites must be met (if applicable)
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Uses multiple repositories (Enrollment, Course, User, MaterialProgress)
 * - Throws domain exceptions for business rule violations
 * - Manages transactions for data consistency
